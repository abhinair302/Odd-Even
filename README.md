# 🏏 Odd-Even Hand Cricket Game

Welcome to the **Odd-Even Hand Cricket Game**, a simple and fun terminal-based cricket game built in Python. Test your luck and strategy against the computer — toss, bat or bowl, and try to win the match (and maybe even a super over! 😉)

- 🏏 **Batting and Bowling Modes**
- 🔁 **2 Innings System**
- ⚡ **Super Over** in case of a tie
- 😄 **Interactive Console UI** with emoji feedback and simple graphics

## 🛠️ Built With

- Python 3
- `random` module
- Console I/O
- Object Oriented Programming Using Python

## 🔮 Future Updates

This project is **not over yet** — it is still evolving!

Here are some exciting features and improvements planned for future versions:

- 🎨 **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** – Build a more visual and interactive version using libraries like Tkinter or Pygame.
- 👥 **Multiplayer Support** – Add a two-player mode where two users can play turn by turn on the same system or over the network.
- 🏏 **Multiple Wickets System** – Instead of getting out on the first ball match, allow users to play with 2 or 3 wickets (like in real hand cricket).
- 🕒 **Ball-Based Game Format** – Implement matches based on a fixed number of balls or overs, simulating real cricket gameplay rules.
- 🧠 **Computer Intelligence** – Add smarter computer decision-making (basic AI logic).
- 💾 **Scoreboard and Match History** – Track match outcomes, player performance, and display scorecards.

## 💡 Developer Note

This is **one of the projects I've built entirely based on my own idea and thought process**. I loved playing this game (using Hand) in real-life with my friends during my school days. From designing the game flow to modular coding, it involved enough brainstorming, hard work, and creating a roadmap to bring it all together.

It's a project that reflects my **creativity, coding effort, and desire to keep improving** — and I look forward to making it bigger and better with time! 🚀
